# VanillaTicTacToe
A simple tic-tac-toe game using only html/css/vanilla Javascript

UI is ugly, I might update it later. 
The project is part of a series of small projects I'm doing for the purpose of revisiting the Javascript language using
no libraries or external dependencies.

Demo can be seen [here](https://vanilla-tictactoe.surge.sh/)
